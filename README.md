## Hi, I'm Ar√£ Ara√∫jo 


### About me
- I'm majoring in Software Engineering at Brigham Young University - Idaho with a minor in CIT.
- I enjoy working on backend systems, but I also like to do a little bit of frontend. In frontend I like to develop for mobile devices mainly.
- I'm doing my minor in CIT because I really like DevOps.
- I'm from Brazil, therefore I love to play soccer. ‚öΩ

### What am I learning now?
- I'm putting a lot of my time in Flutter and Typescript.
- I have some projects that I'm using flutter for the frontend and typescript for the API.
- I'm also studying more about containers like dockers these days.

### Colaboration

I'm always up to colaborate in mobile apps. If you have any projects in Flutter or Swift you can always reach out to me and I will be glad to help.
The same goes for backend systems like APIs or bare c++ programs haha.
